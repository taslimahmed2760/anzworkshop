The `rating-api` is a NodeJS application that connects to mongoDB to retrieve and rate items. Below are some of the details that you'll need to deploy this.

- `rating-api` on GitHub: <https://github.com/RH-ANZ-Workshops/rating-api>
- The container exposes port 8080
- MongoDB connection is configured using an environment variable called `MONGODB_URI`

### Fork the application to your own GitHub repository

To be able to setup CI/CD webhooks, you'll need to fork the application into your personal GitHub repository.

### Use the OpenShift CLI to deploy the `rating-api`

> **Note** You're going to be using [source-to-image (S2I)](#source-to-image-s2i) as a build strategy.

{% collapsible %}

We'll now deploy the `rating-api` app. **Don't miss the entry in the following command where we need you to add your GitHub username**.

```sh
oc new-app https://github.com/<your GitHub username>/rating-api --strategy=source
```

{% endcollapsible %}

### Configure the required environment variables

{% collapsible %}

First we'll need to get to the correct screen. Ensure you're in the **Administrator** view, then navigate to **Workloads -> Deployments**, selecting **rating-api**, and move to the **Environment** tab.

![Navigate to create MONGODB_URI environment variable](media/rating-api-envvars-navigate.png)

We can now create the environment variable using the NAME `MONGODB_URI`. The VALUE should look like `mongodb://[username]:[password]@[endpoint]:27017/ratingsdb`. You'll need to replace the `[username]` and `[password]` with the ones you used when creating the database. You'll also need to replace the `[endpoint]` with the hostname acquired in the previous step.

> **Note** Don't miss replacing your student number in the following VALUE entry. 

The VALUE should look something like this: **mongodb://ratingsuser:ratingspassword@mongodb.workshop<student#>.svc.cluster.local:27017/ratingsdb**

Hit **Save** when done.

![Create a MONGODB_URI environment variable](media/rating-api-envvars.png)

It can also be done with an OC command.

```
oc set env deploy/rating-api MONGODB_URI=mongodb://ratingsuser:ratingspassword@mongodb.workshop<student#>.svc.cluster.local:27017/ratingsdb
```

{% endcollapsible %}

### Verify that the service is running

{% collapsible %}

You can navigate to the logs of the `rating-api` deployment by going **Workloads -> Pods** and selecting the  **rating-api** pod that is currently **running**, 

![Navigate to verify mongoDB connection](media/rating-api-navigate.png)

If you move to the **Logs** tab, you should see a log message confirming the code can successfully connect to the MongoDB.

{% endcollapsible %}

### Retrieve `rating-api` service hostname

{% collapsible %}

Find the `rating-api` service.

```sh
oc get svc rating-api
```

Once you replace your student name in the following, the service will be accessible at this DNS name over port 8080: `rating-api.workshop<student#>.svc.cluster.local:8080` which is formed of `[service name].[project name].svc.cluster.local`. This resolves only within the cluster.

### Setup GitHub webhook

To trigger S2I builds when you push code into your GitHub repo, you'll need to setup the GitHub webhook.

{% collapsible %}

The easiest way to access the URL needed to create the webhook in GitHub is through the web console. If you navigate to **Builds -> Build Configs** and selecting **rating-api**, you will see the copy option for the GitHub webhook URL near the bottom of the page. You’ll use this copied URL to setup the webhook on your GitHub repository.

![Rating API GitHub webhook URL](media/rating-api-github-webhook-url-console.png)

If you prefer to use the command line, start by retrieving the GitHub webhook trigger secret. This is incldued if you copy from the web console, but you'll need to gather it separately for use the GitHub webhook URL if you use the command line.

```sh
oc get bc/rating-api -o=jsonpath='{.spec.triggers..github.secret}'
```

You'll get back something similar to the below. Make note the secret key in the red box as you'll need it in a few steps.

![Rating API GitHub trigger secret](media/rating-api-github-secret.png)

Retrieve the GitHub webhook trigger URL from the build configuration.

```sh
oc describe bc/rating-api
```

![Rating API GitHub trigger url](media/rating-api-github-webhook-url.png)

Replace the `<secret>` placeholder with the secret you retrieved in the previous step to have a URL similar to `https://api.qv4g35sq.westeurope.aroapp.io:6443/apis/build.openshift.io/v1/namespaces/workshop01/buildconfigs/rating-api/webhooks/zLKX0A_0CQs6qWNwQqpV/github`. You'll use this URL to setup the webhook on your GitHub repository.

In your GitHub repository (e.g. `https://github.com/<your GitHub username>/rating-api`), navigate to **Settings -> Webhooks** and select **Add Webhook**.

![Rating API GitHub webhook navigation](media/rating-api-github-webhook-navigation.png)

Paste the URL output (similar to above) into the **Payload URL** field.

Change the Content Type from GitHub’s default **application/x-www-form-urlencoded** to **application/json**.

Click **Add webhook**.

![GitHub add webhook](media/rating-api-github-addwebhook.png)

You will likely see a warning message appear about the effect of disabling SSL verification and its implications. Confirm the setting change, as this is a non-production environment.

![GitHub add webhook warning](media/rating-api-github-addwebhook-warning.png)

If you click back into the newly created webhook, you should see a new tab called **Recent Deliveries** showing a green tick.

![GitHub webhook success](media/rating-api-webhook-success.png)

> **Note** Because GitHub changes its UI regularly, you might see **Recent Deliveries** in a different location than shown in the screenshot above, such as at the bottom. You can also refresh the browser a few moments after saving the newly created webhook and you'll see the green tick beside it.

![GitHub webhook success2](media/rating-api-webhook-success2.png)

Now whenever you push a change to your GitHub repository a new build will automatically start in OpenShift. After a successful build, a new deployment will be triggered as well.
